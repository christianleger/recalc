Changing Visual Studio configuration. 

In project Recalc properties: 

- changing command from $(TargetPath) to bin/recalc.exe

- changing working directory from $(ProjectDir) to $(SolutionDir)/../../../

Now we can run the app where it is bundled with its runtime libs. Is this the correct 
way to run things in Visual Studio? I don't know and I hope someone will fix this and 
document it properly if it ever becomes necessary.
