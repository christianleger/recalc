changing it, learning from it or telling me what you think about it.

This is Recalculant. 

A game, a simulation and a journey. 

This life is so full of wonders, and sometimes we need to dive straight through 
the wormhole of the mind and emerge in places where everything is possible. 

The infinite possibilities of humanity are what interest me. 

I want to dream awake, think in visions, always connected to the possible and 
the real while always striving further into the realm of could-be-real. 

These motivations and many more are behind my decision to build Recalculant, 
around 2006 or earlier.
