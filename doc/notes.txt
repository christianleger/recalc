Shit just got real. 

We are going forward with our bastard child of octaedit, and see if it can 
spawn something other than an absolute disgusting monstrosity.

It's time to make a game engine that is at least a game engine, but also 
at least a computational experimentation engine. 

My need to pursue my imagination in the realm of the possible worlds of simulation 
brings me to a resolution to build and use a 3D game engine that performs any realizable 
computation or simulation in a manner and frequency that I choose. 


The goal is fun, learning, communicating what we know and what we want, and 
making the best of what we find in this universe. 



We have many, and far challenging grounds to cross. 

But we live, we seek and we explore, and the state of action of the mind is 
blissful when self-sustaining. 



GOALS GOALS GOALS to purse ---- ... 


    - to render what should be visible and knowable 

    - to act with fidelity, alacrity and utility

    - to react every time you require it
